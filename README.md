This is a collection of command-line tools I wrote to make various repetitive tasks more convenient. They will typically take input from standard input and will output to standard output.

* [numlist](numlist.cpp): Perform various basic tasks on a list of numbers
    * The list of numbers must be passed in via standard input
    * Run it without arguments to see the usage message, which contains a list of functions
    * The list of numbers can be integers or decimals: the tool handles both
    * The numbers must be delimited by spaces and/or newlines (not by commas or any other symbols)
